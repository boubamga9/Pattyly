# Onboarding – Micro-SaaS Pâtissiers

## Purpose

The onboarding flow ensures that each pastry chef completes the minimum setup to operate their shop. This includes:

1. Setting up the public shop information.
2. Connecting their Stripe account (Stripe Connect).

## Trigger

- Automatically triggered after login if:
  - No shop exists for the user, or
  - `shop.stripe_id` is missing.

## Steps

### 1. Shop Creation
- Form to collect:
  - Shop name
  - Bio / description
  - Public slug (`/[slug]`)
  - Logo (optional)
- On submit → create record in `shops` table linked to user.

### 2. Stripe Connect
- Display Stripe Connect button.
- Redirects to Stripe onboarding flow.
- On return, save `stripe_id` to `shops` table.
