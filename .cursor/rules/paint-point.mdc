# Pain Points – Independent Pastry Chef

## ⏳ Time Management and Client Response

- Response time to messages can be long (around 6 to 7 hours)  
- Risk of losing clients because customers contact multiple providers  
- The first provider to respond usually wins the order  

## 🕵️ Redundant Information

- Clients ask questions that are already answered in the highlighted Stories  
- Time lost repeating the same information  

## 📅 Availability and Order Management

- Difficulty managing availability and daily scheduling  
- Need for a centralized system to handle quotes, orders, client information, and customer service  

## 📦 Logistics and Unforeseen Events

- Busy schedule involving errands and collecting packages from different locations  
- Handling unforeseen issues like late deliveries  
- Need to quickly buy supplies from specialty shops if needed  

## 🎂 Customizing Orders

- Manually creating toppers (decorative cake elements)  
- Time-consuming process: sketching on software, cutting, customization (color, text, finish, font)  
- A system where clients can choose their cake and customize the topper directly on the platform would save significant time  
- This task currently takes about 1 hour per day
